    <h1>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</h1>
        Ayn Rand’s philosophy of “Objectivism” suggests that humans are meant to
        live life free from all forms of political control, and to live life for
        their own selfish desires. In doing so, all humans then become heroes,
        because we become our own heroes, for we are the only ones that matter.
        Objectivism was essentially the creation of a new style of morality.
        While this may seem selfish and against many human’s initial instinct
        towards altruism, objectivism is still very applicable in our lives in
        that it enforces the message that we must live for ourselves, for we are
        in power of whether or not we are happy and satisfied with the way our
        lives are.

    <h1>How was the internet shaped by Objectivism?</h1>
        Objectivism shaped the internet because our society, specifically
        beginning with a group of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, began to
        shift towards the idea of living life for themselves and free from any
        political or governmental or “greater” power, and therefore turned to
        computers to achieve this. It was suggested that new computer
        technologies could turn everyone into heroes because computer networks
        could create a new order of control where politics wouldn’t be involved.
        Although there was a fear that too much power to the individual would
        eventually lead to anarchy, there was a cybernetic dream where computers
        and the internet would be used to create a “self-stabilizing system”
        where we’d be “completely free to follow our own desires.” A great
        example of this was the early projected computer game called “Pong,”
        created by Loren Carpenter. The game required the crowd to work as a
        team to place the paddle where it needed to be in order to keep the ping
        pong ball in play. Carpenter believed he created his own society where
        everyone decided where they wanted to be without any guidance, yet
        “since they were guided by a machine, there was still an order.” This is
        a very simplified example of how the internet can help humans achieve
        objectivism because with the internet, though people have the freedom
        of choice, they can still form “a subconscious consensus.”
