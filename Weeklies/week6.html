    <h1>What is the purpose of XENOFEMINISM?</h1>
      <p class="blueText">Xenofeminism, abbreviated as XF, constructs a
      feminism adapted to our complex reality. It exists to address and suit a future
      in which the realization of gender jusstice and feminist emanicipation contribute
      and apply to the entire universe. XF runs off of the believe that "natural"
      does not exist, and that the concept itself is ridiculous and is the reason
      for alienation. XF is also a rationalism in the way that if someone were to
      argue it was radical, you could point out that patriarchy is radical in the
      same exact way. The goal of XF is that there is no "feminine" or "masculine", but rather
      the goal that everyone speaks as no one in particular, thereby putting everyone
      on a level playing field. Xenofeminism exists to address gender inequality in way
      where gender and other limiting aspect of our culture no longer exist, making us
      also equal.
