    <h2>Point 1</h2>

    <h2>Point 2</h2>
    For a second, I thought that this story was going to be a metaphor
    for the internet. There's a section on page 15 where Harfex states
    that feelings or this fear that Osden experiences is "merely a
    network of processes." There was a lot of language implies a lot
    of interconnected-ness, such as "nodal junctures", "electrochemical
    impulses", and even the line "all the biosphere of a planet should
    be one network of communcation."

        Empathy, aka Osden's entire life</a>
    <h2>Point 4</h2>
    I don't entirely understand the ending or what the overall theme is.
    So here is how I feel:
