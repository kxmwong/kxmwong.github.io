    About Position: As the Director of Camp Programming, I am responsible for planning, scheduling, and implementing all programs and logistics for the week of camp that Troy Camp holds each summer. By coordinating with other executive board positions, I organize all counselor training sessions throughout the year, both in preparation for camp and other programming, in order to establish a well-informed and thoroughly prepared counselor base and successful summer camp for our campers!

    Why TC?: THE KIDS!!!! I have never left any TC event with my heart not filled to the brim in excitement and love because of them! Furthermore, Troy Camp is a space for both counselors AND campers to be their truest and unparalleled selves, which leads to greater mutual discussions and experiences encapsulating growth, endearment, compassion, and altruism. Regardless of whether they're a counselor or a camper, every member of TC serves as a source of fun, love, support, and inspiration! Every moment is a learning and loving moment, which is rare to find and lucky for us to have!

    Greatest Memory in TC: As a 5th grade cabin counselor at camp this year, I'm forever grateful for how compassionate, compatible, and caring all my girls were for each other. I watched my girls facilitate everything -- their schedules, the energy of the cabin, and their friendships -- on their own with such ease. Every night before bed, I would simply just quietly sit in my bunk and observe the room, watching my girls brush and braid each others hair while chatting, getting ready to go to bed. While being unacknowledged seems like a strange fond memory, I remember realizing that Troy Camp is not for the counselors, but for our kids. The reality is, our campers will be in each others lives much longer than their camp counselors will be; most campers go to programming because they look forward to seeing the friends they made at camp. Knowing that my girls were able to effortlessly bond in a single week reassures me that they will continue to attend TC programming long after our generation of counselors graduate. Furthermore, this experience reminded me that kids are truly exceptional; they thrive on individuality, and are always capable of so much more than we expect them to be. â€‹
